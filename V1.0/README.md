# The Horizontal Communication Standard

The information on this page explain how the horizontal communication works.

### What is the Horizontal Communication?

If you are here, probably you are in developing something or you are in charge to manage a traceability project to follow the Brazil Regulation about the SNCM.

Based on the ANVISAÂ´s decision to keep their efforts to handle only the Vertical Communication of the drug traceability, the market need to find a way to improve the efficiency of the data exchange on the supply chain. 

This search for efficiency, means that we need to have some standard interfaces to provide a faster onboarding of the trading partners in Brazil. If we start looking only on the private market, we have more than 70000 drugstores, 2000 distributors and 400 pharmaceutical companies to connect. It can consume a lot of time (and money) when we look at the traditional approach that the service providers usually use to connect the trading partners.

In the image below you can see the *red line* representing the Vertical Communication that is the data exchange between the companies and the regulatory authority (ANVISA). In *blue* you can see what we are addressing in this standard that is the communication among trading partners in the supply chain..

### What does this standard implement?

This standard developed by a GS1 Brazil Workgroup developed some common artifacts that enable the interoperability between trading partners. This artifacts are basically a set of Interfaces and Messages that act as a glue between companies in the supply chain. The messages here developed are basically an Envelope that carry the SNCM information from one Trading Partner to another.

Additionally, the standard implement a common Query Interface that enables the companies to query information on the HC Databases. It means that the standard enable pushing or pulling strategy.

### What does we have inside the HC Standard?

The standard basically implements a Webservice whith 3 simple methods that allows the data exchange between the companies. In addition we also developed some XML artifacts that can act as an Envelope to provide a standard wey to package and route messages among the supply chain.

### What is the technology and security of the HC Standard?

In the beginning of the work, the workgroup made some assumptions to speedup the development and put the focus on the most important points to work. 

The main assumption were that we do not need stay focused on the technology because it can became an infinite loop. Now a days we have many good alternatives on the market and each member of the group could have their own preferences. 

Based on that, we have decided to keep the same stack that ANVISA is using. With this strategy we can save time discussing the technology and can save a lot of money in terms of software development because, the same developer that need to implement the vertical connection to the SNCM also can develop the horizontal communication.

In this way, we are following the same stack of the SNCM System that means:

- The use of the SSL (Secure Shell Layer) over HTTP communication.
- Mutual Authentication using the ICP-Brasil Digital certificates
- Electronic Signature on the XML messages to assure the authenticity and integrity of the messages.
- SOAP Webservices

### Anatomy of the Webservice

The technology behind the main interface of the Horizontal Communication is SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol). This technology is a well known technology which many companies already have developers that knows it.

The Standard has only one webservice which contains 3 methods that enable the communication.

The webservice named DataWS are responsible to make available the methods below.

| Method | Description | Input | Return|
|--------|-------------|--------|--------|
|sendMessage|Method responsible to provide a standard way to receive messages| [InboundMessage](SoapUI_Requests/sendMessageRequest.xml) |[InboundResponse](SoapUI_Requests/sendMessageResponse.xml)|
|getMessage| Method responsible to provide a query interface with the system| [QueryRequest](SoapUI_Requests/getMessageRequest.xml) |[QueryResponse](SoapUI_Requests/getMessageResponse.xml) |
|getPreferences|Method responsible to provide the partner preferences to the network| [QueryRequest](SoapUI_Requests/getPreferencesRequest.xml) |[PreferenceData](SoapUI_Requests/getPreferencesResponse.xml)|

For more information about the webservice, please look at the WSDL file.

[DataWS - Web Service Descriptor Language](WSDL/DataWS.wsdl)

### Messages

As we told before, the standard is a set of artifacts that can enable the communication between trading partners acting as a glue between then. To perform this task using the webservice above, we need to have a set of Messages that can be used as a Envelope to enable the routing between the parts.

Below you can see the list of Messages

| Message  | Purpose | Sample File | Reference |
|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Authorization | Provide a way to inform the Attorney<br> of a specific trading partner | [Authorization.xml](XML_Samples/Authorization_SIGNED.xml)| Reference |
